# Changelog

## 0.3.0 — 2026-08-23

- Shipped the macOS/Windows secure setup helper with WordPress core browser
  approval, loopback callbacks, Keychain/Credential Manager storage, exact
  origin checks, bounded responses, and redacted output.
- Added the Quip Bot setup API 1.0 workflow for status, closed-schema validation,
  approved SHA-256 apply, idempotency, verification, snapshot rollback,
  write-only provider entry, and separately approved go-live.
- Added quip.bot browser authorization with PKCE S256, short-lived single-use
  codes and grants, site-bound encrypted activation tokens, and no raw license
  key in the assisted flow.
- Enforced one production plus three non-production Pro connections, individual
  disconnects, and a new installation identity when a database clone changes URL.
- Added `connection.md` and `configuration.json` artifacts, runnable helper
  commands, an expanded release checklist, and guided fallback for incompatible
  plugins, Linux, or unavailable native credential storage.
- Made WordPress disconnect delete the local native credential even when the
  site is offline, and invalidated readiness whenever provider credentials,
  provider choice, or model choice changes.
- Verified the full isolated local journey: browser consent, namespace scope,
  OS storage, configuration approval/apply/verify/rollback, Pro activation,
  validation, disconnect, remote WordPress revocation, cleanup, and adversarial
  rejection of PKCE, redirect, expiry, replay, scope, and cross-site failures.

## 0.2.1 — 2026-08-22

- Standardized the public product name as **Quip Bot** throughout the skill,
  generated setup artifacts, agent metadata, and human documentation.
- Revalidated the installation and field-level guidance against the official
  Quip Bot 3.11.0 release and raised the documented compatibility floor.
- Preserved the `quip-setup` skill slug, `quip-skill` repository, `iqb` API
  namespace, and `quip.bot` domain as compatibility-sensitive identifiers.
- Migrated the legacy generic `references/` drawer to the descriptive
  `contracts/` folder and updated every workflow and human-doc cross-link.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-08-20

- Added the working human-guided wp-admin path so the skill can complete setup
  before the public automation API and credential helper ship.
- Added verified installation instructions using the open `npx skills` CLI.
- Mapped the current Quip Bot admin sequence across provider testing, Setup,
  Knowledge base, Templates, privacy, preview, and separate go-live approval.
- Kept authenticated browser control and secret handling human-owned while
  distinguishing guided setup from blocked direct automation.
- Reconciled the free-forever core, direct provider billing, and separate
  Quip Bot Pro license boundary from the Aug 19 product meeting.
- Closed the independent cold-start forward-test gaps: explicit opening gate,
  official-package installation path, version/runtime checks, staging vs.
  production decision, backup and rollback, a field-level 3.10.0 map, classified
  verification gates, and owner-supplied research provenance.
- Split readiness from go-live authorization, added the inactive-plugin route,
  normalized unresolved preflight states, expanded owner privacy/operations
  decisions, and made error/offline verification preserve write-only keys.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-08-17

- Added the five-stage Research → Questions → Connect → Configure → Verify
  workflow from the Quip Bot product discussion.
- Added public-site research, owner-answer, configuration-plan, and verification
  artifacts.
- Locked the security model: browser consent is human-operated, provider keys
  remain write-only in WordPress, and credentials never enter the AI transcript.
- Marked WordPress writes honestly blocked until the stable public Quip Bot setup API
  and OS-native connection helper are released.
- Kept the free Quip Bot setup independent from a quip.bot account or paid license.
