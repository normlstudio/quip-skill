# Action: connect WordPress safely

## Choose the path

Fetch the public `GET /setup/compatibility` endpoint (no authentication; try
`<origin>/wp-json/quipbot/v1/setup/compatibility`, then
`<origin>/?rest_route=/quipbot/v1/setup/compatibility`). Use the API path only
when **all** of the following hold — the helper re-checks the same gate itself:

- `available: true`;
- `"1.0"` in `schema_versions`;
- capabilities include `status`, `validate`, `apply`, `verify`, `rollback`,
  `go_live`, `provider_write`, `self_revoke`;
- `site_url` equals the owner-supplied origin after normalization;
- the operator's machine is macOS (the helper's only credential backend in
  this release) and the owner agrees to run the helper.

Record the outcome in the configuration plan:

```yaml
connection: api | guided-manual
# guided-manual only — why the API path was not taken:
reason: multisite | plugin-predates-api | owner-declined-helper | credential-backend-unsupported
```

## Automated flow (shipped)

1. Validate the canonical WordPress origin and HTTPS (the helper enforces
   HTTPS outside local development hostnames).
2. Run the connect subcommand — the agent may run it; the human approves in
   their own browser:

   ```bash
   node helper/quip-setup-helper.mjs connect https://example.com
   ```

3. The helper fetches compatibility, applies the gate above, then starts a
   loopback-only listener (random 127.0.0.1 port, unguessable path and
   `state`) and opens WordPress core's Application Password authorization
   screen in the system browser. Nobody — helper or agent — reads or drives
   that browser.
4. The human signs in and approves or rejects the **Quip Bot setup**
   application request.
5. On approval, the helper validates the exact `state`, accepts one terminal
   callback only, stores the generated credential in the macOS Keychain
   **before producing any output**, serves a static close-tab page that strips
   the query from browser history, and closes the listener. On rejection, a
   wrong state, or a second callback it exits non-zero and stores nothing.
6. The helper writes the non-secret connection record to
   `~/.quip-setup/<origin-slug>.json` (origin, `rest_url`, `user_login`,
   `connected_at`, connection policy) and smoke-tests `GET /setup/status`.
7. Record only the redacted summary the helper prints: connection status,
   origin, user login, connected-at, policy, smoke result. Never the
   credential — the helper never prints it.

Warn the operator up front: the connection has a **two-hour hard lifetime**
(measured from credential creation — the whole run must finish inside it) and
a **30-minute idle timeout**. A mid-flow 401 means the connection expired or
was revoked; re-read compatibility and run `connect` again.

## Transcript boundary

- The agent may run `connect`, `status`, `call`, and `disconnect`. Their
  output is non-secret by construction.
- The `provider` subcommand must run in the **human's own interactive
  terminal**: it prompts for the provider key on its own TTY with echo off.
  Never ask for the key in chat, in a file, or as a command argument.
- Do not ask to see the browser, inspect the DOM, take over the session,
  receive a screenshot of authenticated wp-admin, or collect a credential in
  chat — on either path.

## Ending the connection

- A successful `POST /setup/go-live` revokes the connection itself
  (`connection_revoked`); do not run `disconnect` after it.
- When stopping early without going live, run:

  ```bash
  node helper/quip-setup-helper.mjs disconnect https://example.com
  ```

  It calls `DELETE /setup/connection`, then deletes the Keychain item
  regardless of the HTTP outcome (the server may already have reaped the
  credential). The plugin also enforces the idle/lifetime windows and a cron
  sweep on its own, so a crashed helper never leaves a usable credential
  behind.

## Guided flow (fallback)

1. Validate the canonical WordPress origin and HTTPS.
2. Confirm the user is already signed in to an authorized WordPress account in
   their own browser.
3. Record `connection: guided-manual` and the explicit `reason` in the
   configuration plan.
4. Follow `contracts/admin-guided-path.md` after the plan is approved.
5. The human performs every authenticated action and reports only non-secret
   state such as provider name, model, test passed/failed, and saved/not saved.

Do not fall back to a normal WordPress password, a credential pasted into the
terminal or chat, browser automation, SSH, or database access — the missing
API path blocks only direct agent writes, not the setup itself.

## Future Quip Bot authorization

The free core requires no quip.bot account. A future device-authorization flow may
be added only for paid entitlements or managed services. It must use a browser
consent step and return a scoped token to the OS credential store without
exposing it to the agent. No such flow — and no `/license/*` operation — exists
in the shipped API.
