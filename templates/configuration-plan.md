## Provider-key action

The human enters the key directly in the write-only Quip Bot settings UI. The
agent may later confirm only provider, model, `has_key`, and test status.

## Guided apply sequence

1. Approve this non-secret plan.
2. Human connects and tests the provider in Quip Bot Settings.
3. Human applies a reviewed preset or site-analysis draft.
4. Human reviews Knowledge base, Templates, legal text, contacts, notifications,
   retention, appearance, and language.
5. Human keeps visibility off and runs the preview verification.
6. Receive separate go-live approval.
7. Human enables visibility and verifies one public session.

## Automated write sequence (API path)

1. Connect through the shipped helper (`connect`); note the two-hour hard
   lifetime and 30-minute idle timeout.
2. Read current setup state (`GET /setup/status`).
3. Build the envelope from this approved plan and `POST /setup/validate`.
4. Show the validate summary and warnings; receive explicit production-write
   approval.
5. `POST /setup/apply` with `approval.confirmed: true` and the server's
   `configuration_sha256`; record apply_id / rollback_id / idempotency key.
   Visibility stays unchanged.
6. Human enters the provider key through the helper `provider` subcommand;
   `POST /setup/provider/test`.
7. `POST /setup/verify` plus the checklist's human-observed behavior tests.
8. Receive separate go-live approval.
9. `POST /setup/go-live` (revokes the connection) and verify one public
   session.
