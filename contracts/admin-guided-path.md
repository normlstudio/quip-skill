# Guided Quip Bot admin path

This is the **fallback path**. The default is the API path through the shipped
setup API and credential helper (`actions/connect.md`); use this guided
sequence when the compatibility gate does not pass or the owner declines the
helper — multisite, a plugin that predates the setup API, or a platform
without a supported credential backend. The human remains in control of the
authenticated WordPress browser. The agent prepares the plan, explains each
step, and records non-secret confirmations.

## Before entering wp-admin

1. Complete `preflight.md`: canonical origin, authority, installation/version,
   environment, backup/reset path, rollback, and visibility off.
2. Record the current non-secret baseline from
   `contracts/installation-and-rollback.md`.
3. Complete `research.md`, `owner-answers.md`, and the field-level rows in
   `configuration-plan.md`.
4. Keep Quip Bot in preview mode until verification passes.
5. Ask for explicit approval of the plan before the human changes WordPress.

## Human-operated sequence

### 1. Connect the AI provider

Open **Quip Bot → Settings → AI providers**.

- Choose Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, or OpenRouter.
- Choose a listed model or enter a provider-supported custom model ID.
- The human pastes the provider key into the password field.
- Click **Test connection**, then **Save settings**.
- Record only provider, model, and whether the test passed. Never ask for the
  key, its prefix/suffix, an authenticated screenshot, or a copied response.

The site owner pays the provider directly. Quip Bot core is free forever. A
future Quip Bot Pro license does not include provider inference.

### 2. Give the assistant starting knowledge

Open **Quip Bot → Setup**.

- For a no-cost starting point, apply the closest industry preset and review
  every generated topic afterward.
- For site-specific generation, use **Analyze my site** only after the provider
  test passes. Review the collected pages and generated draft before applying.
- Never treat generated facts, consent text, or regulated guidance as approved
  merely because the plugin created them.

### 3. Review knowledge and behavior

Open **Quip Bot → Knowledge base**.

- Compare business facts and Q&A entries with `research.md` and owner answers.
- Keep hard rules and prohibited claims explicit.
- Remove unsupported facts and add missing escalation boundaries.

Open **Quip Bot → Templates** and review visitor-facing prompts and fallbacks.

### 4. Review operations and privacy

Open **Quip Bot → Settings** and review these sections:

- **Legal texts** — consent and short disclosure.
- **Contacts** — lead destination and contact routes.
- **Notifications** — digest behavior and recipient.
- **Anonymous conversations** — retention and browser-memory choice.
- **Human takeover** — return-to-assistant behavior.
- **Widget appearance** and **Languages** — approved identity and language scope.

Use `contracts/configuration-fields.md` to record every field separately,
including its environment, data classification, verification, and rollback.

Do not enable paid-only behavior without a valid entitlement. Do not promise a
public setup API, managed inference, or WordPress.org availability before each
is actually released.

### 5. Preview, verify, and go live separately

Keep **Settings → Visibility → Make the bot live for visitors** off. Use the
plugin's preview link to run the verification checklist.

After every readiness-blocking check except L04 passes, ask separately:

> The reviewed setup passes the guided verification. Do you approve making
> Quip Bot live for visitors on this site now?

Record the explicit yes as L04 passed. Only then should the human enable
visibility and save. Verify one public conversation without putting visitor
personal data in the setup artifacts.

## Status values

Record these in `configuration-plan.md`:

```yaml
connection: guided-manual
reason: multisite | plugin-predates-api | owner-declined-helper | credential-backend-unsupported
provider_test: pending | passed | failed
configuration: planned | human-applied | verified
go_live: off | approved | live
```

Never use `passed` or `verified` based only on an instruction being shown. The
human must confirm the result or the public behavior must be independently
observable without authentication.
